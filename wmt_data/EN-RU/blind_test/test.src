the database copy Active Directory object has an invalid parent database object . the parent database object may be marked as DEL ( deleted ) , CNF ( conflict ) , or may not be found .
the database Active Directory object has been marked as CNF ( i.e. it was chosen as a conflict victim ) . this usually happens due to multiple objects being created with the same name on different Domain Controllers . the Remove @-@ MailboxDatabase and New @-@ MailboxDatabase cmdlets can be used to remove or fix the invalid database copy object .
