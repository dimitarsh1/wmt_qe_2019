PrioritizeSharePointOnPrem : the sync client will look at SharePoint on @-@ premise server before SPO for a user 's OneDrive for Business personal site . if the sync client is already configured with SharePoint on @-@ premise server for the signed in user , it will attempt to configure a SPO OneDrive for Business instance for that user . if you disable this setting , the behavior is equivalent to option PrioritizeSPO .

file Content Change Tracking allows you to view the file content of a changed file before and after the change . in order to provide this service , the file content data must be stored in a storage account after each change to that file is reported
storage Account where changed files will be stored for File Content Change Tracking . a container name " changetrackingblob " will be created in this storage account , where all the files will be uploaded .
turning on File Content Change Tracking and selecting a storage account will generate a shared access signature ( SAS ) URI that grants restricted write access to the selected storage . the SAS URI will grant the Change Tracking service access to write file content resources to the storage account for a specified period of time . during SAS Url generation , the container named " changetrackingblob " will be created in the selected storage account if it does not already exists . an access policy with write only permission will be added to the container , and the SAS Url will be created with the access policy . the SAS Url can be revoked anytime by deleting the access policy or by turning off File Content Change Tracking .

intelligent scoring that reflects your organization ’ s compliance posture against data protection regulations and standards .
risk assessment workflow and management tools that provide task assignment and verification to help Governance , Risk & Compliance teams and IT departments work together to streamline internal compliance activities .
at @-@ a @-@ glance summary of the shared responsibility model reflecting both Microsoft 's and your organization ’ s data protection and compliance posture for standards and regulations such as ISO 27001 : 2013 , NIST 800 @-@ 53 , the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) , the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) and others .
recommended actions for business policies and cloud @-@ based features and services that improve your organization ’ s data protection capabilities and regulatory compliance posture .
activity and evidence tracking that helps you centralize your organization ’ s compliance @-@ related activities and provides a secure evidence repository that is accessible only by authorized individuals in your organization .
detailed reports of assessment activities that combine Microsoft ’ s and your organization ’ s assessment information into a single Excel file that can be provided to internal and external auditors and regulators .
compliance Manager uses the Assessments as the basis for managing your compliance activities . assessments include a cloud service and a standard or regulation . when you open Compliance Manager , you 'll see your organization 's progress towards completing each Assessment . to get you started , we 've added Assessments for ISO 27001 : 2013 and ISO 27018 : 2014 for Azure and ISO 27001 : 2013 , NIST 800 @-@ 53 , and the GDPR for Office 365 .
the Assessments dashboard displays Assessments that have been created . each Assessment displays a progress indicator for two sets of controls : those managed by Microsoft , and those managed by your organization . assessments are used to track your organization 's compliance efforts . each set of controls is organized by same control family or other grouping as used by each standard or regulation .
in the Customer Managed Controls section , you ’ ll find recommended actions for facilitating monitoring for and verifying your organization ’ s compliance with the requirements of each control . you can add your organization ’ s implementation details , test plan , and management responses as part of completing an Assessment .
in the Microsoft Managed Controls section , you ’ ll find implementation details for each control , and details about how and when the control was tested and validated by a third @-@ party independent auditor of Microsoft ’ s cloud services . if any Findings are recorded in one of these audits , it will be noted and a Microsoft management response will be included .
compliance Score within Compliance Manager helps you to figure out what actions you can take to improve your organization 's compliance posture . compliance Score provides you a risk @-@ based score that is calculated on Assessment activity . it looks at whether each assessed control is Preventive , Detective , or Corrective and whether it is Mandatory or Discretionary , it considers the impact of control failure on the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of data , and it factors in the legal and regulatory risks arising from control failure .
click the name of the Assessment to open it and view detailed information about the controls included in the Assessment , such as the list of In Scope Services :
the Customer Managed Controls section provides you with recommended actions that your organization can take along with tools to facilitate data protection and compliance management . each family of controls include control IDs , titles and descriptions , along with a list of related controls from other standards and regulations , and the Compliance Score for the control . each control also includes workflow , tracking , and evidence gathering features that enable you to :
enter implementation details , test plan information , test details , implementation and test dates , and test results ;
upload evidence to verify compliance activities and control implementations .
data entered and uploaded in Compliance Manager is accessible to your entire organization by default . for information about how to control who in your organization can access this data , see the Compliance Manager * * support article * * . Microsoft personnel do not have standing access to data that you enter or upload . any data entered or uploaded into Compliance Manager will be stored in the United States on Microsoft Cloud Storage that is compliant with Tier C standards of our * * Compliance Framework * * .
each assessment activity increases your overall Compliance Score , and once an Assessment is completed , the Assessment results will be reflected on the Assessments dashboard , along with a final Compliance Score for the Assessment .
start tracking your organization 's compliance activities by creating an Assessment or by using one of the out @-@ of @-@ box Assessments that have been created for you . if you have any comments , questions , suggestions or other feedback , please use the Feedback button on the bottom of your screen to send it to us .

confirm , that you want OMS to automatically extend all alerts in your workspace to Azure .
for all alerts in OMS with same actions , we propose creating one action group in Azure . we are listing below a summary of your alerts and our optimal proposal of action groups for them .
this would be done in background and will take sometime , proportionate to the alerts & actions in your workspace . during this time you will not be able to edit your alerts , but you can continue to create new alerts using Azure .
alerts in Azure , are also not limited to 250 like in OMS . further Azure Alerts uses Action Groups to enable alert notification via new channels like SMS , Voice etc. and now you can associate multiple webhooks or runbooks as well .
now you can extend your alerts into Azure - allowing you to use Azure Alerts , to manage all your various alerts in one place . everything from Application Insights based log alerts to Monitor based metric alerts to Activity log alerts ; can be viewed , created and managed from Azure Alerts .
the spreading algorithm determines how VMs in the scale set are balanced across fault domains . with max spreading , VMs are spread across as many fault domains as possible in each zone . with fixed spreading , VMs are always spread across exactly 5 fault domains . in the case where fewer than 5 fault domains are available , a scale set using " Max spreading " will still complete deployment , while a scale set using " Fixed spreading " will fail to deploy .
the balance of a scale set refers to how close the number of VMs in each zone matches the number of VMs in other zones . if this option is enabled , scale operations on the scale set will fail if it is not possible to maintain balance across zones . if this option is disabled , scale operations will temporarily allow for an imbalance between zones in order to complete the scale operation .

first , let 's choose a time . based on recent trends within your calendar , we recommend three blocks of Focus Time .
don 't let meetings take over . if a new meeting conflicts with your scheduled focus time , consider the urgency of the meeting and if it can be rescheduled .
for example : I see very few or no documents in Delve - what can I do ? why can ’ t I change all my profile information ? who can see my documents ?
get back to your favorite boards and documents . only you can see what you ’ ve added to your favorites .
get back to your favorite hashtags and documents . only you can see what you ’ ve added to your favorites .
attach a resource
hashtags you ’ ve added to or marked as favorites will show up here .
boards you ’ ve added to or marked as favorites will show up here .
give IT a shout and they 'll get you going .

how would you rate MyAnalytics ? tell us what you like and don 't like .
here 's a snapshot of your last week .
recommended for current user
if key decision makers and stakeholders are not able to attend , reschedule so you don 't have the same meeting twice .
if you choose not to share your activity , others won 't see your documents and actions in Delve , and you won 't be able to see the documents and actions of others .
if you want to see documents , change your Feature settings , and we ’ ll show the documents you have access to .

it 's tempting to respond immediately . turn off email and Skype notifications to mentally recharge .
looks like you haven 't sent any emails in Office 365 yet . send a few emails , and check back again .
let them know why you 're sharing

this policy setting allows you to reduce the number of actions in Office that will result in a document 's VBA digital signature becoming invalidated . the VBA project may be modified in certain ways that change the project storage but that do not invalidate the source code digital signature . with this setting turned off , these actions will lead to the VBA digital signature being invalidated , and the signature dropped on save if the user does not have the private key available to resign . with this setting on , we will only perform a resign of the project if the source code signature has changed , and will keep the existing signature in other cases . if the VBA project storage is changed and saved , but the old signature retained under this feature , this can lead to an invalidation of the saved compiled VBA project state . if this happens , the VBA project will be forced to recompile each time the document is loaded . this may have negative performance impacts for larger VBA projects . once a document is in this state , the state will persist until the VBA project is resigned .
